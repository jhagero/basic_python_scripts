Hi :)

Nothing set in stone, everything subject to change.

Implemented a Fallout ROBCO style print() function
replacement that can be patched in for simple console
applications to be a little more fun to use (albeit 
slightly slower).

I made a wrapper/decorator that measures the time in 
ms for a function to complete and has a little bit
of error handling.
